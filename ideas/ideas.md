# Ideas
- [ ] Read *Fluent in 3 Months: How Anyone at Any Age Can Learn to Speak Any Language from Anywhere in the World* by Benny Lewis
- [ ] Apply the [Learn in Public method](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)
- [ ] Apply Dan Luu's excruciating method (the one where he talks about how his friend did the whole book exercice by exercice, at first it is slow but it becomes exponentially easy)
- [ ] Master Anki
- [ ] Memorize by writing **ad infinitum** (and see if it works)

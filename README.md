# Speedrun German to C1
This is a repo where I will try to speedrun my way from A? to C1 in German. I will be using the "Learn in Public" method of Swyx to get fast learning loops and methods.
This (3/Oct) is the first day I am logging my progress. But for the last month I have been getting some German learning by osmosis.
On September I did :
  - An immersive 2 week Gemran course in HsH
  - I have been learning for an hour a day (or so when I am not out) German with the book (*Grammaire Allemande, simple et pratique* by Spaeth, Real & Wertheim)
  - Learning words either by reading excerpts of German, by trying to understand the ads, panels and else in my commmute.

But it's not enough, to get to a real minimal C1 level in German I will need tracking, discipline and coordination. A few of the future steps I am going to apply to my learning :
  - [ ] Doing the audio-guided Method course of [Michael Thomas](https://archive.org/details/GermanFoundationMThomas)
  - [ ] Doing a ~200 verb [Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1602108197)
  - [ ] Doing an [A1-A2 nouns](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/295302039)
  - [ ] Doing the [2000 most common German words](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/553941876)
  - [ ] Doing half the book (*Grammaire Allemande, simple et pratique* by Spaeth, Real & Wertheim) in 2 weeks. **NB: Buy a lot of paper and HB recharges.**
 
These are the short-term objectives, and as a way to track myself I will be committing day by day updating a weekly file.
For now the format will be listing what I learnt, what I think I have doubts on and need to brush and the objectives for the day after.

**Ich wünsche dir viele Glück in dieses Erlebnis.**
This is a publicaly viewable but privately held repo, no requests will be accepted and thus I strongly recommmend anyone who wishes to do a similar experiment to fork this repo or create their own one.
